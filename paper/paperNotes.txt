#Outstanding questions to consider
- CV for # epochs, or simply set the w2v and f2v epochs to be equal?
- things to try with w2v
  -try with "natural" document lengths
  -try with SG
  -try without null keys  (would have to do same for F2V)


for both ranking schemes, do with "natural data structure" rather than artificial censoring

#Outstanding Issues
- masking zero cats in the F2v Lib; this is pretty important
