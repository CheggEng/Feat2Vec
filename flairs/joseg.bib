@techreport{Dhanani:survey,
	Abstract = {In the knowledge-tracing model, error metrics are used to guide parameter estimation towards values that accurately represent students' dynamic cognitive state. We compare several metrics, including log likelihood (LL), root mean squared error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), to evaluate which metric is most suited for this purpose. LL is commonly used as an error metric in Expectation Maximization (EM) to perform parameter estimation. RMSE and AUC have been suggested but have not been explored in depth. In order to examine the effectiveness of using each metric, we measure the correlations between the values calculated by each and the distances from the corresponding points to the ground truth. Additionally, we examine how each metric compares to the others. Our findings show that RMSE is significantly better than LL and AUC. With more knowledge of effective error metrics for estimating parameters in the knowledge-tracing model,  we hope that better parameter searching algorithms can be created.},

Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the relative performance of the confidence intervals for the AUC in terms of coverage probability and average interval length. A real example is used to illustrate the application of the recommended methods. },

We incorporate such domain knowledge using a novel Dirichlet Forest prior in a Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework. The prior is a mixture of Dirichlet tree distributions with special structures. We present its construction, and inference via collapsed Gibbs sampling. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our model's ability to follow and generalize beyond user-specified domain knowledge.},

@article{sur1962,
	Abstract = {In this paper a method of estimating the parameters of a set of regression equations is reported which involves application of Aitken's generalized least-squares [1] to the whole system of equations. Under conditions generally encountered in practice, it is found that the regression coefficient estimators so obtained are at least asymptotically more efficient than those obtained by an equation-by-equation application of least squares. This gain in efficiency can be quite large if "independent" variables in different equations are not highly correlated and if disturbance terms in different equations are highly correlated. Further, tests of the hypothesis that all regression equation coefficient vectors are equal, based on "micro" and "macro" data, are described. If this hypothesis is accepted, there will be no aggregation bias. Finally, the estimation procedure and the "micro-test" for aggregation bias are applied in the analysis of annual investment data, 1935-1954, for two firms.},
